# Amirkabir IoT Research Center

## Our story

We began our journey at [AoLab](https://github.com/AoLab), where we accomplished some outstanding work in the fields of Home Automation Systems and IoT Platforms. Following our success, the university decided to establish multiple laboratories for IoT research, leading to the closure of AoLab. Subsequently, a new research center was established with a primary focus on IoT Platforms. Our inaugural and, ultimately, final project at this center was [I1820](https://github.com/I1820/).

Although we had developed an impressive prototype named [mia](https://github.com/I1820/mia) at AoLab, we needed to modify it to meet the requirements of [ISRC](https://isrc.ac.ir/) - our contractor at the time. Unfortunately, these changes led to what we now refer to as the great failure of [I1820](https://github.com/I1820/I1820).

There are numerous factors that contributed to this failure, but the predominant issue was the ambiguity of the IoT Platform requirements at that time. This ambiguity resulted in a platform that attempted to do too much and, as a result, failed to excel at any of its functions.

We maintain this repository as a testament to those times; it serves as a reminder of the camaraderie we shared and the remarkable work we accomplished together.
